# Ken Garff eSports Spring 2022 Capture the Flag Competition Scripts

These are scripts that I wrote to help solve flags for the Capture the Flag competition hosted by [Ken Garff eSports](https://www.kengarffesports.org/). These scripts are written in TypeScript and have their own folders in the repository. They are named after the flag they solve. These scripts were written by Alek Evans for the KingTux team. This is published for learning, not to be plagiarized for future competitive use. A README is included in each script to explain what it is, what it does, and how to use it.
